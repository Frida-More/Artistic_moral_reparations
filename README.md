This repository contains the R code and dataframe used for a QCA study on artistic moral reparations in Colombia.
The first column of the dataframe states the names of the 21 cases analysed. The other four columns correspond to the outcome-- SATEX: satisfactory experience-- and the three conditions-- APART: active participation, Cohe: coherence and Comm: communicability--. The sets named with capitalised letters are already calibrated. The other two are calibrated in the analysis included in the R file. 
The whole process is described and explained in my thesis available at UNSWorks http://hdl.handle.net/1959.4/103790
